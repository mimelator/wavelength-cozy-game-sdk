## Quick Setup Prompt
*Copy and paste this to any AI assistant to get started immediately*

```
I'm using the VIBE Coding SDK to create cozy games for hub.wavelength.com that generate passive income through the Badge Driven Merch Experience.

VIBE Coding is a visual, intuitive system for non-programmers to build peaceful games using JSON configuration files instead of code. The focus is on cozy, accessible, mobile-friendly games with themes like nature exploration, gentle collection mechanics, and stress-free experiences.

The Badge Driven Merch Experience works like this: Players earn badges in games, badges go to their personal gallery, players create and buy merch featuring badges THEY earned, and I earn 35% of every sale automatically.

This creates powerful revenue because:
- Players buy merch featuring achievements THEY earned
- Personal connection drives higher conversion rates
- Each player can earn multiple badges = multiple revenue streams
- Popular badges continue selling as new players discover them

Please help me create games using this system. I'll be working with:
- game.json files for all customization
- Badge configurations that become player-driven revenue streams
- Simple HTML templates that work automatically
- Themes like "forest", "ocean", "sunset", "midnight", "spring"
- Collection-based gameplay with items using emojis and rarity levels
- Mobile-first design with touch controls
- Deployment to hub.wavelength.com

Focus on designing memorable, meaningful badges that players will be proud to earn and excited to wear on merchandise. Ask me what kind of cozy game I want to create and help me configure it for maximum Badge Driven Merch appeal!
