Hi! I want to create a cozy collection game using the VIBE Coding system. Please guide me through this step-by-step.

**IMPORTANT**: Please follow these rules:
- Break this into small, clear steps
- Show me emojis and visual examples
- Let me make creative choices (don't decide everything for me)
- Keep it fun and encouraging
- DON'T show me JSON or code until the very end
- Ask me to approve each step before moving on

**My game idea**: [Describe your cozy game idea here]

Examples:
- "A peaceful beach where I collect seashells and sea glass"
- "A magical forest where I find glowing mushrooms and fairy lights" 
- "A cozy library where I discover floating books and ancient scrolls"
- "A mountain meadow where I collect wildflowers and butterflies"
- "A space station where I find memory crystals from lost astronauts"

Please start by helping me refine my concept and showing me what items I might collect!

**That's it!** Paste this to ChatGPT, replace the [Describe your cozy game idea here] part with your idea, and you'll get step-by-step guided game creation.

## 📋 What Will Happen:

1. **Concept Refinement** - ChatGPT will clarify your vision and suggest collectible items
2. **Item Design** - You'll choose what players collect (with fun emojis!)
3. **Theme Selection** - Pick colors and mood from 3 visual options
4. **Badge Creation** - Design achievement badges players will earn
5. **Final Review** - See your complete game before creation
6. **File Generation** - Get the actual game files to test and play

The whole process takes 5-10 minutes and results in a playable cozy game!
